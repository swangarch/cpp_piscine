# CPP_Piscine - Personal Learning Summary

This repository contains my solutions and notes from the **C++ Piscine** at 42 School.  
It reflects what I have learned while completing each exercise, from basic syntax to advanced C++ concepts.

## üìö What I Learned

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ cpp00 - Basics
- C++ syntax and control structures (if/else, loops, switch)  
- Basic input/output with `iostream`  
- Using variables, constants, and data types  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ cpp01 - Classes and Objects
- Defining classes and creating objects  
- Member functions, attributes, and access modifiers  
- Understanding constructors and destructors  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ cpp02 - Constructors & Member Functions
- Overloading constructors  
- Copy constructor and assignment operator  
- Understanding object lifecycle  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ cpp03 - Inheritance
- Class inheritance, including **diamond inheritance**  
- Access specifiers and multiple inheritance  
- Resolving ambiguity in complex inheritance hierarchies  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ cpp04 - Abstract Classes & Interfaces
- Creating **abstract classes** and **interfaces**  
- Implementing inheritance and overriding virtual functions  
- Understanding **polymorphism** and dynamic binding  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ cpp05 - Exception Handling
- Using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`  
- Creating custom exception classes  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ cpp06 - Type Casting
- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`  
- Converting between pointer types and safely downcasting  
- Understanding cast limitations and safety  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ cpp07 - Templates
- Function and class templates  
- Writing generic and reusable code  
- Understanding template specialization and type parameters  

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ cpp08 - STL Containers & Algorithms
- Using vectors, lists, maps, and sets  
- Iterators and range-based loops  
- Applying standard algorithms like `sort`, `find`, and `transform`  

### üîü cpp09 - Advanced C++ Concepts
- Implementing advanced algorithms (e.g., Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort)  
- Further practice with efficiency optimization  
- Improving performance and memory management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Coding Practices
- Avoided global code, structured everything with `main` functions  
- Followed 42 School coding standards and best practices  
- Used **canonical form** (default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor) when applicable  
- Protected header files with include guards or `#pragma once`  
- Focused on readability, maintainability, and modular design
